# Atemo Cajaku's scripts
Various scripts for my own use, of questionable quality.

---

## Ubuntu - `Desnap.sh` and `Desnap.iso`
This script is meant to remove all snaps from a clean and untouched installation of Ubuntu 24.04. \
It will replace them with the Flatpak packaging system, install gnome-software and its appropriate plugin, and revert to the previous Ubuntu fonts that are much more readable. \
The ISO file is provided mostly for use inside a virtual machine, where once can easily mount the ISO file and test the script inside a virtual machine before using it on actual hardware.
